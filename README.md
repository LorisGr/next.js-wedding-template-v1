## Digital Wedding Invitations (Paperless Wedding Invitations)

This project is a full-stack web application that aims to assist couples in planning and organizing their wedding day. Built using Next.js and MongoDB and Firebase, it features a user-friendly form that collects all the necessary information based on the couple's specific requirements, such as the number of guests and any special requests or preferences.

The **landing page** is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing couples to provide all the necessary information with ease. Once the form is completed, the collected information is displayed in a **dashboard** on a separate URL. This allows couples to review and keep track of any changes or updates. The dashboard is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it simple for couples to manage their wedding details.

## Upcoming plans include:

- plan to implement Redux for enhanced state management

- The responsive dashboard includes a sidebar similar to GitLab pages
- You can view the collected data from the form in a user-friendly table or cards 
- Additionally, there is a button provided to download a PDF containing all the collected form data



### API endpoint 'api/login'

This is an endpoint for handling user authentication and login. When a user submits their username and password, the endpoint will verify their credentials. If the credentials are valid, the endpoint generates a unique session ID and sets it in a cookie. If the credentials are not valid, the endpoint returns an error message. The endpoint also uses MongoDB to store and retrieve user data and sessions.

#### To test:

```bash
username:Maciek
# and
password:secretpassword

```

### Landing Page

The landing page provides basic information about the event. In the future, I plan to integrate the landing page with Sanity CMS, allowing the owner to easily add and update the content of the landing page.
