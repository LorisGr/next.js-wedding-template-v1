## Digital Wedding Invitations (Paperless Wedding Invitations)

This project is a full-stack web application that aims to assist couples in planning and organizing their wedding day. Built using Next.js and MongoDB, it features a user-friendly form that collects all the necessary information based on the couple's specific requirements, such as the number of guests and any special requests or preferences.

The landing page is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing couples to provide all the necessary information with ease. Once the form is completed, the collected information is displayed in a dashboard on a separate URL. This allows couples to review and keep track of any changes or updates. The dashboard is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it simple for couples to manage their wedding details.

Additional features, such as a budget tracker and guest list manager, will be added in the future to solve problems associated with traditional paper invitations.
